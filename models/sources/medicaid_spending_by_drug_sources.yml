          The Medicaid by Drug dataset presents information on spending for covered outpatient drugs prescribed to
          beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid by physicians and other healthcare professionals.

          The dataset focuses on average spending per dosage unit and change in average spending per dosage unit over
          time. Units refer to the drug unit in the lowest dispensable amount. It also includes spending information for
          manufacturer(s) of the drugs as well as consumer-friendly information of drug uses and clinical indications.

          Drug spending metrics for Medicaid represent the total amount reimbursed by both Medicaid and non-Medicaid
          entities to pharmacies for the drug. Medicaid drug spending contains both the Federal and State reimbursement
          and is inclusive of any applicable dispensing fees. In addition, this total is not reduced or affected by
          Medicaid rebates paid to the states.
