          The Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Nurse Staffing and Non-Nurse Staffing datasets provide information submitted
          by nursing homes including rehabilitation services on a quarterly basis. The data include the hours staff are
          paid to work each day, for each facility. Examples of reporting categories include Director of Nursing,
          Administrative Registered Nurses, Registered Nursing, Administrative Licensed Practice Nurses, Licensed
          Practice Nurses, Certified Nurse Aides, Certified Medication Aides, and Nurse Aides in Training. There are
          also other non-nurse staff categories provided in the data such as Respiratory Therapist, Occupational
          Therapist, and Social Worker. The datasets also include a facility’s daily census calculated using the Minimum
          Data Set (MDS) submission.
