          The Medicare Part B Discarded Drug Units dataset provides spending information on claims for Medicare Part B
          drugs that were identified as having discarded amounts of a drug. As of January 1, 2017, the Centers for
          Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires all physicians, hospitals, and other providers submitting claims
          for Medicare Part B drugs to report any discarded amount of a single use vial or other single use package drug
          on its claim for payment. With the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in November 2021,
          manufacturers must pay a refund to Medicare for discarded amounts above a specified threshold effective for
          drugs furnished beginning with January 1, 2023.
