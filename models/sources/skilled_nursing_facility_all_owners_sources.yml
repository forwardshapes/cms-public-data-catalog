          The Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) All Owners dataset provides information on all owners of SNFs currently
          enrolled in Medicare. This data includes ownership information such as ownership name, ownership type,
          ownership address and ownership effective date.

          On November 17, 2023, CMS published in the Federal Register a final rule titled, “Medicare and Medicaid
          Programs; Disclosures of Ownership and Additional Disclosable Parties Information for Skilled Nursing
          Facilities and Nursing Facilities; Medicare Providers’ and Suppliers’ Disclosure of Private Equity Companies
          and Real Estate Investment Trusts” (88 FR 80141). This final rule implements parts of section 1124(c) of the
          Act which requires SNFs to disclose detailed information about their ownership and management as well as
          additional data regarding: (1) other parties with which the SNF is associated; and (2) the ownership
          structures of these other parties. Refer to Medicare Enrollment for Providers & Suppliers for more information
          on the Skilled Nursing Facility disclosure requirements.

          Section 6101(b) of the Affordable Care Act states that no later than 1 year after final regulations
          promulgated under section 1124(c) of the Act are published in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall make
          the information reported available to the public.

          On November 21, 2024 CMS updated this dataset to include this reported information.
