          The Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model: Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) dataset presents
          MSAs that are participating in the CMS Innovation Center Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model, a
          model to support better and more efficient care for beneficiaries undergoing the most common inpatient surgery
          for Medicare beneficiaries: hip and knee replacements. Participation in this model is designated by geographic
          area, specifically MSAs. The information contained in the dataset can include MSA identification number, MSA
          geographic name and associated county or counties.
