          The Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) dataset provides raw data reported by any applicable
          laboratories that reported a volume greater than 10 tests for the data collection period. As described by the
          Protecting Access to Medicare Act, Applicable Laboratories must report to CMS private payor rates and
          associated volumes for laboratory tests on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule.
