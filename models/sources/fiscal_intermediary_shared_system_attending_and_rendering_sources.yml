          The Fiscal Intermediary Shared System (FISS) Attending and Rendering dataset provides a list of those
          attending and rendering physicians for the FISS. FISS edits require that the Line Item Rendering Physician
          information be transmitted when providers submit a combined claim. Claims that include both facility and
          professional components, need to report the rendering physician or other practitioner at the line level if it
          differs from the rendering physician/practitioner reported at the claim level.

          Note: This full dataset contains more records than most spreadsheet programs can handle, which will result in
          an incomplete load of data. Use of a database or statistical software is required.
