          The Publicly Reported Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Measures data provides
          information on hospital-level measures rates for four of the HACs included in the DRA HAC payment provision –
          foreign object retained after surgery, blood incompatibility, air embolism, and falls and trauma – for
          Medicare fee-for-service discharges. The Publicly Reported DRA HAC Measures are reported only for
          informational and quality improvement purposes; the results of the measure calculations do not affect payment
          and are not a part of the HAC Reduction Program.
