          The Medicare Fee-For-Service Public Provider Enrollment dataset includes information on providers who are
          actively approved to bill Medicare or have completed the 855O at the time the data was pulled from the
          Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). The release of this provider enrollment data is not
          related to other provider information releases such as Physician Compare or Data Transparency.
