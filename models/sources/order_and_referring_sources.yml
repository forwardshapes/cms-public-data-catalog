          The Order and Referring dataset provides information on all physicians and non-physician practitioners, by
          their National Provider Identifier (NPI), who are of a type/specialty that is legally eligible to order and
          refer in the Medicare program and who have current enrollment records in Medicare. This dataset identifies
          Medicare fee-for-service ordering and referring eligibility, supporting transparency and regulatory compliance
          efforts. The information can be used to verify ordering and referring capabilities as required by Medicare
          program standards.
