          The Restructured BETOS Classification System (RBCS) dataset is a taxonomy that allows researchers to group
          healthcare service codes for Medicare Part B services (i.e., HCPCS codes) into clinically meaningful
          categories and subcategories. It is based on the original Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS)
          classification created in the 1980s, and includes notable updates such as Part B non-physician services. The
          RBCS will undergo annual updates by a technical expert panel of researchers and clinicians.
