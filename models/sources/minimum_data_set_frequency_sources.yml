          The Minimum Data Set (MDS) Frequency data summarizes health status indicators for active residents currently
          in nursing homes. The MDS is part of the Federally-mandated process for clinical assessment of all residents
          in Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes. This process provides a comprehensive assessment of each
          resident's functional capabilities and helps nursing home staff identify health problems. Care Area
          Assessments (CAAs) are part of this process, and provide the foundation upon which a resident's individual
          care plan is formulated. MDS assessments are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes,
          regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on
          admission to the nursing facility, periodically, and on discharge. All assessments are completed within
          specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health
          care professionals employed by the nursing home. MDS information is transmitted electronically by nursing
          homes to the national MDS database at CMS.

          When reviewing the MDS 3.0 Frequency files, some common software programs e.g., ‘Microsoft Excel’ might
          inaccurately strip leading zeros from designated code values (i.e., "01" becomes "1") or misinterpret code
          ranges as dates (i.e., O0600 ranges such as 02-04 are misread as 04-Feb). As each piece of software is unique,
          if you encounter an issue when reading the CSV file of Frequency data, please open the file in a plain text
          editor such as ‘Notepad’ or ‘TextPad’ to review the underlying data, before reaching out to CMS for
          assistance.
