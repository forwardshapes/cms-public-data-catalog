          The Medicare Dialysis Facilities data provides information on clinical and patient measures for
          Medicare-certified ESRD facilities, also known as dialysis facilities. It contains data on patient
          characteristics, treatment patterns, hospitalization, mortality, and transplantation patterns in
          Medicare-certified dialysis facilities.

          The following four data files are available for download each year, where yyyy denotes the fiscal year.

          DFR_Data_FYyyyy.csv file includes all summaries (facility- and regional-level) reported in the Dialysis
          Facility Report (DFR). The file includes one record for each dialysis facility and is the file recommended for
          download (i.e., wide format). dfr_facility_socrata_fyyyyy.csv file includes only facility-level summaries
          reported in the DFR. The file includes one record per measure per year (i.e., long format) and contains more
          records than most spreadsheet programs can handle, which will result in an incomplete load of data. Use of a
          database or statistical software is required. dfr_us_state_socrata_fyyyyyy.csv file includes state- and
          national-level summaries reported in DFR. The file includes one record per measure per year (i.e., long
          format). dfr_network_socrata_fyyyyyy.csv file includes ESRD network-level summaries reported in the DFR. The
          file includes one record per measure per year (i.e., long format).
