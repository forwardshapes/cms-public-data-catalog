          The Medicare Part D by Drug dataset presents information on spending for drugs prescribed to Medicare
          beneficiaries enrolled in Part D by physicians and other healthcare providers. Drugs prescribed in the
          Medicare Part D program are drugs patients generally administer themselves.

          The dataset focuses on average spending per dosage unit and change in average spending per dosage unit over
          time. It also includes spending information for manufacturer(s) of the drugs as well as consumer-friendly
          information of drug uses and clinical indications.

          Drug spending metrics for Part D drugs are based on the gross drug cost, which represents total spending for
          the prescription claim, including Medicare, plan, and beneficiary payments. The Part D spending metrics do not
          reflect any manufacturers’ rebates or other price concessions as CMS is prohibited from publicly disclosing
          such information.
