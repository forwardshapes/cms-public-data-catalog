          The Revalidation Due Date List dataset contains revalidation due dates for Medicare providers who are due to
          revalidate in the following six months. If a provider's due date does not fall within the ensuing six months,
          the due date is marked 'TBD'. In addition the dataset also includes subfiles with reassignment information for
          a given provider as well as due date listings for clinics and group practices and their providers.
