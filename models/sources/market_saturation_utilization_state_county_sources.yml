          The Market Saturation and Utilization State-County dataset provides monitoring of market saturation. Market
          saturation, in the present context, refers to the density of providers of a particular service within a
          defined geographic area relative to the number of beneficiaries receiving that service in the area. The data
          can be used to reveal the degree to which use of a service is related to the number of providers servicing a
          geographic region. There are also a number of secondary research uses for these data, but one objective of
          making these data public is to assist health care providers in making informed decisions about their service
          locations and the beneficiary population they serve.
