          The Medicare Inpatient Hospitals by Provider and Service dataset provides information on inpatient discharges
          for Original Medicare Part A beneficiaries by IPPS hospitals. It includes information on the use, payment, and
          hospital charges for more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that received IPPS payments. The data are organized by
          hospital and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (DRG).

          Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients, and these charges are
          the amount the hospital bills for an item or service. The Total Payment Amount includes the DRG amount, claim
          per diem amount, beneficiary primary payer claim payment amount, beneficiary Part A (Hospital Insurance)
          coinsurance amount, beneficiary deductible amount, beneficiary blood deductible amount and diagnosis related
          group outlier amount.
