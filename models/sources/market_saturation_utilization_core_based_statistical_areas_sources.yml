          The Market Saturation and Utilization Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) dataset provides monitoring of
          market saturation. CBSAs are geographical delineations that are Census Bureau-defined urban clusters of at
          least 10,000 people. Market saturation, in the present context, refers to the density of providers of a
          particular service within a defined geographic area relative to the number of beneficiaries receiving that
          service in the area. The data can be used to reveal the degree to which use of a service is related to the
          number of providers servicing a geographic region. There are also a number of secondary research uses for
          these data, but one objective of making these data public is to assist health care providers in making
          informed decisions about their service locations and the beneficiary population they serve.
