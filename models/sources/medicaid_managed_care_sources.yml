          The Medicaid Managed Care dataset uses CMS' state Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System
          (T-MSIS) data for Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and New Mexico to identify various metrics for managed care plans
          within each state. These metrics are designed to allow users to compare plans in each state across different
          specialty areas (currently Pediatric Dental, Behavioral Health, and Prenatal OB/GYN). This dataset does not
          include all available data in T-MSIS but utilized a subset to calculate the individual metrics identified.
