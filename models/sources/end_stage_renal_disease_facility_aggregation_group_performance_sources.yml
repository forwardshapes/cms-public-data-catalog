          The End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Facility Aggregation Group Performance dataset provides performance
          information in the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices (ETC) Model. The dataset includes
          information on Performance Payment Adjustment (PPA), Modality Performance Score (MPS), home dialysis rate, and
          transplant rate, as well as the individual components of each rate for each model participant ESRD facility
          aggregation group.

          All ESRD facilities within the same aggregation group share the same performance information. The
          supplementary aggregation group crosswalk file may be used to map aggregation groups to individual ETC
          Participant ESRD facilities.
