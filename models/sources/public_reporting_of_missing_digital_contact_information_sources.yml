          In the May 2020 CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule, CMS finalized the policy to publicly
          report the names and NPIs of those providers who do not have digital contact information included in the
          National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) system (85 FR 25584). This data includes the NPI and
          provider name of providers and clinicians without digital contact information in NPPES.
