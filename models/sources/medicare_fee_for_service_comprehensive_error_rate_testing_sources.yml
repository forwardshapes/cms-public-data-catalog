          The Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) dataset provides information on a
          random sample of FFS claims to determine if they were paid properly under Medicare coverage, coding, and
          payment rules. The dataset contains information on type of FFS claim, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and
          Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, provider type, type of bill, review decision, and
          error code.

          Please note, each reporting year (RY) contains claims submitted July 1 two years before the report through
          June 30 one year before the report. For example, the 2025 data contains claims submitted July 1, 2023 through
          June 30, 2024.
