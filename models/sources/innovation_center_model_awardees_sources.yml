          The Innovation Center Model Awardees dataset provides information about institutions that have participated
          in the model process, and have been awarded funding based on their efforts to design, implement, or test
          innovative healthcare delivery initiatives. The data includes the name of the institution, related keywords,
          project name, geographic reach, funding amount, real or projected 3-year savings, a summary of the
          institutions activities in the model, categories related to the type of healthcare initiative, stage of
          participation, and the URL for the model or initiative page on the CMMI website.
