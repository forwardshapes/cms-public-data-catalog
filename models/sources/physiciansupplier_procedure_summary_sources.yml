          The Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary (PSPS) data provides a summary of calendar year Medicare Part B
          carrier and durable medical equipment fee-for-service (FFS) claims. The file is organized by carrier, pricing
          locality, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, HCPCS modifier, provider specialty, type of
          service, and place of service. The summarized fields are total submitted services and charges, total allowed
          services and charges, total denied services and charges, and total payment amounts. This dataset is produced
          annually and is typically available in July (i.e., data for CY2015 is usually available in July 2016).
