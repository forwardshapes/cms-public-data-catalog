          The Medicare Part D Prescribers by Geography and Drug dataset contains information on prescription drugs
          prescribed by individual physicians and other health care providers and paid for under the Medicare Part D
          Prescription Drug Program. For each drug, the dataset includes the total number of prescriptions that were
          dispensed, which include original prescriptions and any refills, and the total drug cost. The total drug cost
          includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration
          fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any
          other third-party payers.
