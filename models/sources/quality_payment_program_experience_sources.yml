          The Quality Payment Program (QPP) Experience dataset provides participation and performance information in
          the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) during each performance year. They cover eligibility and
          participation, performance categories, and final score and payment adjustments. The dataset provides
          additional details at the TIN/NPI level on what was published in the previous performance year. You can sort
          the data by variables like clinician type, practice size, scores, and payment adjustments.
