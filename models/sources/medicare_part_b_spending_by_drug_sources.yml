        description: |
          The Medicare Part B by Drug dataset presents information on spending for drugs administered in doctors’
          offices and other outpatient settings by physicians and other healthcare providers to Medicare Part B
          enrollees.

          The dataset focuses on average spending per dosage unit and change in average spending per dosage unit over
          time. It also includes consumer-friendly descriptions of the drug uses, clinical indications, and
          manufacturer(s).

          Drug spending metrics for Part B drugs represent the full value of the product, including the Medicare
          payment and beneficiary liability. All Part B drug spending metrics are calculated at the HCPCS level.
