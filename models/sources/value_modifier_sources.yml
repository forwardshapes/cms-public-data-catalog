          The Medicare Value-Based Payment Modifier (Value Modifier) data contains the performance results of
          de-identified practices that were subject to the Value Modifier, such as the practices' quality and cost tiers
          along with any applicable Value Modifier payment adjustment. The Value Modifier provided for differential
          payment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule based on the quality of care furnished to Medicare
          beneficiaries compared to the cost of care during a performance period. Calendar Year 2015 was the first
          payment adjustment period under the Value Modifier based on performance in 2013. Calendar Year 2018 was the
          final payment adjustment period under the Value Modifier based on performance in 2016.
