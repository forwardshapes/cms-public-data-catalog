          The Managing Clinician Aggregation Group Performance dataset provides performance information in the
          End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices (ETC) Model. The dataset includes information on Performance
          Payment Adjustment (PPA), Modality Performance Score (MPS), home dialysis rate, and transplant rate, as well
          as the individual components of each rate for each model participant Managing Clinician aggregation group.

          All Managing Clinicians within the same aggregation group share the same performance information. The
          supplementary aggregation group crosswalk file may be used to map aggregation groups to individual ETC
          Participant Managing Clinicians.
