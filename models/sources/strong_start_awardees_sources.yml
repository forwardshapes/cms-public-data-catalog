          The Strong Start Awardees dataset provides information on the financial awards made to participants in the
          Strong Start for Mothers and Newborns Initiative. This initiative tested three evidence-based maternity care
          service approaches with the goal of improving health outcomes of pregnant women and newborns. The data can
          include the participant name, participant location, locations of practices participating under the
          participants’ umbrella practice, descriptive text for the type(s) of enhanced prenatal care provided, and the
          amount of funding awarded to the participant as a result of their participation in year 1 of the initiative.
