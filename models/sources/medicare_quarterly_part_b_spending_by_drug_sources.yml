          The Medicare Quarterly Part B Spending by Drug dataset presents information on spending for drugs
          administered in doctors’ offices and other outpatient settings by physicians and other healthcare providers to
          Medicare Part B enrollees. It also includes consumer-friendly descriptions of the drug uses, clinical
          indications, and manufacturer(s).

          Drug spending metrics for Part B drugs represent the full value of the product, including the Medicare
          payment and beneficiary liability. All Part B drug spending metrics are calculated at the HCPCS level.

          This dataset reports preliminary data that goes beyond the latest date available in the annual Medicare Part
          B Spending by Drug dataset. The data are updated each quarter and may change with each new release due to
          claims lag. Once an entire year of data is available with a sufficient run-out period, that data will move out
          of the preliminary quarterly dataset and into the annual Medicare Part B Spending by Drug dataset. Due to the
          preliminary nature of the quarterly dataset, we advise using caution when comparing between the annual and
          quarterly datasets.
