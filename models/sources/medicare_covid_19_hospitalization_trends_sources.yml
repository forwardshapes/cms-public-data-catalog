          The Medicare COVID-19 Hospitalization Trends dataset contains aggregate information from Medicare
          Fee-for-Service claims, Medicare Advantage encounter, and Medicare enrollment data. It provides insight around
          the groups of beneficiaries that were hospitalized at different points during the pandemic.

          CMS publicly released the first Preliminary Medicare COVID-19 Snapshot in June 2020 during the early stages
          of the Public Health Emergency for COVID-19. That report focused on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations data
          for Medicare beneficiaries with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Throughout 2020 and 2021, that report was subsequently
          updated with refreshed data 13 times. Beginning in October 2021, CMS shifted its public COVID-19 reporting
          away from cumulative case and hospitalization rates to hospitalization trends over time with the release of
          this report, the Medicare COVID-19 Hospitalization Trends Report.

          All prior releases of both the Preliminary Medicare COVID-19 Snapshot and the Medicare COVID-19
          Hospitalization Trends Report are available for download in the Medicare COVID-19 Data - Prior Releases file.
